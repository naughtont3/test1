Various items for Jenkins CI testing.


NOTES
-----
 - The `jenkins_rhea_cpu.sh` script was modified from the example by
   GrahamL and ScottK.  Specifically I used the version from the QMCPACK
   repo, [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/2f6bb1f8646d9176e851c36780cd9d3a9eb6b5a8/tests/test_automation/jenkins_rhea_cpu.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/2f6bb1f8646d9176e851c36780cd9d3a9eb6b5a8/tests/test_automation/jenkins_rhea_cpu.sh).
